# Iris
## Iris Flower Prediction App

This repository contains a simple application for predicting the species of Iris flowers based on user-input parameters using machine learning.

## Overview

The application takes input parameters such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of an Iris flower and predicts its species among setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Usage

### User Input Parameters

- **sepal_length**: Ranges from 4.30 to 7.90
- **sepal_width**: Ranges from 2.00 to 4.40
- **petal_length**: Ranges from 1.00 to 6.90
- **petal_width**: Ranges from 0.10 to 2.50

### Example Input Data

An example of user input data would be:

sepal_length: 5.4
sepal_width: 3.4
petal_length: 1.3
petal_width: 0.2

### Prediction

Upon inputting the parameters, the app predicted the Iris species based on the provided data. For instance:

Predicted Iris Species: setosa

### Class Labels and Indices

The class labels and their corresponding index numbers are as follows:
- setosa: 0
- versicolor: 1
- virginica: 2

### Prediction Probability

The prediction probability for each class index is shown below:
#setosa: 1.0
versicolor: 0.0
virginica: 0.0


# Acknowledgments

The prediction model used in this app is based on the Iris dataset and utilizes machine learning techniques to classify Iris flowers.
